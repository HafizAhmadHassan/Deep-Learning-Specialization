## 1. Introduction

In the week 3 of this coursera specialization Assignment of week 3 was required to submit where students implemented 2 layer neural network
I modified it to 3 layers in order to make sure my understanding of code
Accuracy Achieved from 90 percent to 92 percent

##  2.  Skills You will Learn
a.  Artificial Neural Network
b.  Deep Learning
c.  Backpropagation
d.  Python Programming

## 3. Requirements

Following need to be install to run the code:

  a. Jupyter Notebook
      - __[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)__ -
     	
  b. Python 3.x
    - __[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)__ -
      
  c. Libraries
  
     Once you install above 
     open terminal run following :
     
```
      pip install matplotlib
      pip install numpy   
      pip install sklearn
```


## 4. Architecture


    
## 5. How it works
  
  1. open to terminal and write  
  
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  
  ```
  
  2. Now open this file 

## 6. Results
      
      final result obtained was having 92 percent accuracy
